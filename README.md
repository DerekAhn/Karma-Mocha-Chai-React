* [react-es6-webpack-karma-boilerplate](https://github.com/mvader/react-es6-webpack-karma-boilerplate) is a boilerplate for kick starting a project with the following technologies:
    React
    ES6 with Babel
    Webpack for bundling
    Webpack Dev Server
    React Hot Loader for tweaking React components in real time.
